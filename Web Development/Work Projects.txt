I have worked on projects with my web developmentn job at Brick Bridge Consulting.
These include creating unit tests and creating a web scraper.
Unit Testing:
- called an API
- tested code
- tracked work
- made over 100 tests
Web Scraper:
- scraped data for over 14,000 clients
- scraped data from over 20 different web pages
- used an html agility pack
- scraped data from Counselor Max
- exported the data to excel in a csv format
- imported that data into Podio platform
